##Introduction <br/><br/>
Dellasrecipe was built for a friend who loves cooking and also makes videos about her recipes on the gram.<br/><br/>
We decided to increase the audience by creating a single-page website where her users can make a food subscription.<br /><br/>
I used HTML/CSS to create the page while taking advantage of Javascript for the DOM manipulation. I used GSAP which is an animation Library to create animations across the website. With the help of scroll-magic, i was able to execute a function fired by scroll points instead of using jquery. its a continual project because there is much more to be added to it.
